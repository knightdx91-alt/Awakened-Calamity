      "Taller terrain correctly hides what stands behind it, and characters pass in front of or behind elevation based on where their feet are.",
      "Block height scales with the painted 0–9 value (about a third of a tile per step), so stepped ridges, plateaus, and pillars read as real depth.",

       "Gamepad glyphs auto-detect the player's controller and relabel for Xbox (A/B/X/Y), PlayStation (Cross/Circle/Square/Triangle), and Nintendo Switch (B/A/Y/X); the editor Controls tab has a per-brand preview.",
