# GENERATOR ROADMAP — master doc ("generate better stuff")

**Single source of truth for procedural generation.** This combines the old
`GENERATOR_ROADMAP.md` priority queue with the cross-cutting rules from `MAPGEN_SPEC.md` (now the
detailed per-map-type appendix), and folds in the **procgen technique toolkit** (Reddit
roguelike-procgen summary, saved in Drive) and the **mapping quality bar**
(`MAPPING_PRINCIPLES.md`). Owner asked to keep this queued and be reminded at the start of every
session (wired into `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`).

Detailed references this doc sits on top of:
- **`MAPGEN_SPEC.md`** — full per-map-type rules (town/route/forest/interior/dungeon): RM
  convention vs. our gap vs. target rules. Read before touching a specific map type.
- **`MAPGEN_BUILDINGS.md`** — building/roof/wall/overhang details.
- **`MAPPING_PRINCIPLES.md`** — the "what makes a map good" checklist (condensed below).

## ★ The core insight (why upgrades are cheap)

Our runtime generator `src/systems/mapgen.js` (`GameMapGen`, pure/deterministic) is built on a
`Builder` whose entire post-process — `ensureConnected`, `finalizeWalls`, `renderNorthFaces`,
`repairPropConnectivity`, and the whole gameplay layer (Entrance/StairsDown/Alpha boss, roamers,
chests, relic cache, traps) — **operates generically on the `walk[]` boolean grid**. It does not
care HOW cells got carved.

Today only ONE thing fills `walk[]`: `carveRect` (rectangles) + `carveCorridor` (straight
L-corridors). That is procgen **technique #2 only** (rooms-and-corridors), which is exactly why
floors read boxy and samey. **Upgrading = adding new ways to fill `walk[]`; the existing pipeline
handles connectivity, walls, faces, and population for free.**

---

## The procgen toolkit (techniques + where each fits our Builder)

From the Reddit roguelike-procgen consensus. The #1 takeaway: **it's a toolset — combine, don't
pick one** (e.g. random-walk for shape, then cellular-automata to smooth). Ranked by ROI for us:

| Technique | What it gives | Fit to our Builder | Status / priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cellular Automata** | organic cave/ruins | new `caveFill(region)`: seed ~45% random floor, run 4–5 smoothing passes; existing `ensureConnected` stitches caverns | 🟢 **highest ROI, ~30 LOC** |
| **Drunkard's Walk / Random Walkers** | meandering organic passages (bigger "brush" = wider) | random-walk variant of `carveCorridor` toward target | 🟢 **tiny, ~15 LOC** |
| **Rooms & Corridors (random placement)** | scattered rooms, connected | what we have now (`carveRect`+`carveCorridor`, reject-on-overlap, repair) | ✅ DONE (only this) |
| **Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)** | structured, evenly-distributed rooms; no overlap & connected *by construction*; naturally varied sizes | recursive split → room per leaf → connect siblings up the tree; fills `walk[]`; the "right way" to do the rectangular style | 🟢 **structural upgrade to the rooms style; pairs with CA in `mixed`** |
| **Set Pieces / Prefabs** | hand-authored quality rooms (boss arena, vault, pillar hall); QA-able | tile+event stamp templates placed onto `walk[]`/`over[]`/`events[]`; **BSP leaves are natural prefab slots** | 🟡 **medium effort, high quality payoff** |
| **Graph / Component ("legos")** | room segments w/ connection points, sector algo guarantees connectivity | alt to "carve then repair"; lower marginal value (we already guarantee connectivity) | 🔴 defer |
| **Wave Function Collapse (WFC)** | flexible tiling from adjacency rules | needs a curated tileset-adjacency ruleset — heavy | 🔴 defer |

**Plan = combine:** upgrade the rectangular style to **BSP** (evenly-distributed, non-overlapping,
connected by construction), add **CA caves** as an organic alternate, use **drunkard's walk** for
organic links, drop in **prefabs** for set-pieces — all behind `style: 'rooms' | 'bsp' | 'cave' |
'mixed'` on `generateFloor`. A `mixed` floor can be a **BSP room block + a CA cave wing** (the
"combine techniques" consensus), which also fixes the "huge empty square room" failure mode.

## Priority order (the queue)

1. ✅ **DONE 2026-06-19 — Port `mapgen` to JS for RUNTIME generation.** `src/systems/mapgen.js`
   (`GameMapGen`, pure/deterministic) ports the Python dungeon path: seeded room/corridor carve,
   reachability guarantee (`ensureConnected` + `repairPropConnectivity`), 9-slice walls +
   side-view north faces (baked `dun_props` gids), and the gameplay layer (Entrance, StairsDown/
   Alpha boss, roamers, chests, relic cache, traps). Floor-kind aware: normal floors get a
   StairsDown(`descend`), the last an Alpha(battle→despawn→descend). Engine injection via
   `GameMap.loadGenerated`; descent (`main.js`) grows a fresh floor from `run.seed + floor` when
   `run.json runtimeGen` is on (pool kept as fallback); `_purgeRunFloors` clears reused `RunGenF*`
   names. `tools/test_mapgen.mjs` = 12 checks; browser-verified.

2. **Room-shape variety.** ✅ DONE in part (2026-06-19) — `Builder.carveCaveRoom` carves ORGANIC
   **cellular-automata cave rooms** (seed ~45% wall → 4 smoothing passes → carve, with a force-carved
   centre core so corridors still land on floor). Each room rolls cave-vs-rect by `biome.caveChance`
   (verdara .5 / calderra .35 / halveth .45 / vael .6), so floors mix rectangular halls + caves.
   Reachability still GUARANTEED (`ensureConnected` + `repairPropConnectivity`); `tools/test_mapgen.mjs`
   asserts all-cave floors stay fully reachable + that caves change the floor shape. Big pillared halls
   already exist (rooms ≥7×5). **Still TODO:** BSP structured layout + drunkard's-walk corridors +
   merged/blocked rooms (a `style` selector). *`MAPGEN_SPEC §6`.*

3. **Biome system.** ✅ DONE (2026-06-19) — `data/systems/biomes.json` (4 biomes: verdara/
   calderra/halveth/vael) drives each generated floor's **palette** (base floor tile via the
   `rtp_dungeon_ground` autotile fills), **prop tables**, tier-banded **enemy roster**, **boss
   pool**, **hazard mix** (trap text/dmg/surveil + sensor weight) and encounter rate.
   `GameMapGen.generateFloor` reads `opts.biome`; `main.js` selects it from `run.run.biome` →
   `run.json` `biome` → `biomes._meta.default`. Absent biome → unchanged default behavior.
   `tools/test_mapgen.mjs` = 18 checks (palette/boss/roster/hazard/reachability). **Next (deeper):**
   per-biome **tileset/wall set** (not just floor tile) + biome-driven room-shape mix once #2 lands.
   *Original spec: one biome def per region = palette + autotile set + prop tables + enemy roster +
   hazard + mini-boss, so Verdara/Halveth/Calderra/Vael read as different places (not recolors).*

4. **Run/act composer (Slay-the-Spire map model).** ✅ DONE (2026-06-19) — `src/systems/act.js`
   (`GameAct.compose(seed, length, cfg)`, pure/seeded) lays out a descent as a PACED sequence of
   typed nodes (monster → elite → treasure → rest → boss) instead of a flat pool. Pacing rules
   (data in `data/systems/acts.json`): boss last, monster first, a rest before the boss, weighted
   middle with per-type **min spacing** (no back-to-back elites/rests). Each node carries `gen`
   modifiers that tune `GameMapGen.generateFloor` (`opts.node`): **rest** = no hazards + a campfire
   refuge (full heal once) + no roamers; **elite** = +level + a guaranteed extra roamer + a 2nd
   relic cache; **treasure** = sparse enemies + extra chest + 2nd relic cache. `main.js` composes
   the act at `_runStart` (stored on `run.act`, replay-safe) and reads the node per floor in
   `_genFloor`. The shape is surfaced via `[act]` (glyph map w/ a ▸ cursor) + `[floorlabel]` text
   tokens (shown when examining a floor's Entrance) — onboarding #5's legible run shape.
   `tools/test_act.mjs` = 13 checks; `test_mapgen.mjs` grew to 24 (biome + act-node + cave checks).
   **Hub forecast DONE (2026-06-19):** `[actforecast]` token previews the NEXT descent's shape at
   the hub before you commit — composes the act for the pinned seed (`run_seed_in`); unpinned = a
   note that it's random. Wired into the **DescentGate** (with a glyph legend) + the **Replay Slate**.
   Acts/run DB preloaded at boot so the forecast uses the live pacing config.

5. **Data-driven templates / recipes (`MAPGEN_SPEC §3`).** Author intent in JSON
   (`{biome, anchors, enemy_table, hazard, hook}`); the generator fills detail. Enables hybrid
   authoring (hand-place quest spots, generate the filler) and bridges to the World Bible
   (`data/world/<region>.json`). This is also where **prefabs/set-pieces** get authored.

6. **Smarter enemy/encounter placement.** Telegraphed packs, elite rooms, ambushes, placement
   scaled by depth — not random scatter.

(See also the gameplay assessment: the real game-completeness blockers are enemy/boss variety,
relics, in-run story, audio/juice, and a human playtest — tracked in `FIX_LIST.md`.)

## Mapping quality bar (apply to ALL generated output)

Condensed from `MAPPING_PRINCIPLES.md` (RPG Maker mapping canon) + `MAPGEN_SPEC §0`. Acceptance
criteria — generated floors should pass these by eye:

- **No huge empty square rooms.** Every room earns its space (content or a reason to cross).
  CA caves + room-shape variety (#2) directly attack this.
- **Respect negative space — don't over-clutter.** The old "three-tile rule" (something every
  ~3 tiles) is a *guideline, not gospel*; applied blindly it makes maps messy. Bias prop
  placement toward intentional clusters + deliberate empty space (our current `scatterInRooms`
  is uniform — make it clumpier-but-sparser).
- **Add verticality.** Vary heights; we bake north wall-faces already — extend to elevation
  variation in floor layout, not just walls.
- **Walkable-first composition.** Stake out where the player WALKS first, then decorate.
- **No lines, no grids, no clumps >2.** Scatter with jitter; break straight runs.
- **Consistency of style.** One wall style / roof palette / tile size per map (→ biome system #3).
- **Channel, don't cage.** Steer with soft obstacles; never hard-wall the only route (our
  `repairPropConnectivity` enforces this — keep it).
- **Everything has a reason.** Props match the setting; access to anything interactive.
- **Indoor/outdoor size consistency.** Interior footprints believable vs. their exterior.

## Rejected ideas (log — don't revisit without a new reason)

- **"Quantum" map generator** (Medium: *The Dungeon of Collapse / Schrödinger's Dungeon*,
  Cirq + Hadamard gates over 100 qubits → measure each cell to wall/floor). **Verdict: NO.**
  The "quantum" part is just a randomness *source*; the actual map generation is **per-cell
  random fill** — the most primitive technique there is — producing unstructured noise with no
  rooms and **no connectivity guarantee** (unplayable). Strictly *worse* than what we have, and
  worse still for us specifically: a quantum RNG is **non-deterministic**, which would **break
  our replay-safe same-seed→same-floor guarantee** (the Replay Slate feature). Nothing
  algorithmic to borrow. The CA / drunkard's-walk / prefab techniques above are far more valuable.
